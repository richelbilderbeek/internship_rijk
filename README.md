# internship_rijk

Internship of Rijk at the Rijksuniversiteit (no pun intended) Groningen.

 * Goal: show how working at the university is 
   like, so Rijk can better decide on his future career

 * How: tell him about and show him your work in one of the time slots.
   Topics: your scientific work, your favorite programming language(s),
   writing computer simulations, doing data analysis, plotting results,
   working on your favorite computer cluster, hardware acceleration,
   software development, on-line collaboration, continuous integration
   and all other things on our beloved zeroes and ones 

 * Who is Rijk: he is an (approximately) 16 year old scholar, 
   interested in working with computers,
   and a member of the programming team called 
   [Team Octane](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/djog_unos_2018)

 * Deliverable: Rijk will write a report what we do with computers, as well
   as a summary of what each person is working on
